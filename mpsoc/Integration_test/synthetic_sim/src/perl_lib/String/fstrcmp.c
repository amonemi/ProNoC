/* NAME
	diag - find diagonal path

   SYNOPSIS
	int diag(int xoff, int xlim, int yoff, int ylim, int minimal,
		struct partition *part);

   DESCRIPTION
	Find the midpoint of the shortest edit script for a specified
	portion of the two strings.

	Scan from the beginnings of the strings, and simultaneously from
	the ends, doing a breadth-first search through the space of
	edit-sequence.  When the two searches meet, we have found the
	midpoint of the shortest edit sequence.

	If MINIMAL is nonzero, find the minimal edit script regardless
	of expense.  Otherwise, if the search is too expensive, use
	heuristics to stop the search and report a suboptimal answer.

   RETURNS
	Set PART->(XMID,YMID) to the midpoint (XMID,YMID).  The diagonal
	number XMID - YMID equals the number of inserted characters
	minus the number of deleted characters (counting only characters
	before the midpoint).  Return the approximate edit cost; this is
	the total number of characters inserted or deleted (counting
	only characters before the midpoint), unless a heuristic is used
	to terminate the search prematurely.

	Set PART->LEFT_MINIMAL to nonzero iff the minimal edit script
	for the left half of the partition is known; similarly for
	PART->RIGHT_MINIMAL.

   CAVEAT
	This function assumes that the first characters of the specified
	portions of the two strings do not match, and likewise that the
	last characters do not match.  The caller must trim matching
	characters from the beginning and end of the portions it is
	going to specify.

	If we return the "wrong" partitions, the worst this can do is
	cause suboptimal diff output.  It cannot cause incorrect diff
	output.  */
